# Communication Tools

At Exchequer, our remote and asynchronous workflow relies on clear and effective communication. To maintain efficiency and ensure that everyone is aligned, we use a set of dedicated tools for different types of communication and collaboration. Below is a detailed overview of these tools, including acceptable response times, what should and should not be communicated via each channel, and examples to guide usage, specifically within the context of software development.

### 1. Instant Messenger: Slack <a href="#id-17q8xwz79v3s" id="id-17q8xwz79v3s"></a>

### Purpose <a href="#yq536klt3dou" id="yq536klt3dou"></a>

Slack is our primary tool for real-time, instant messaging. It is best suited for quick updates, informal conversations, and communications that require immediate attention or rapid feedback.

### Acceptable Response Time <a href="#otrljzvjjd9g" id="otrljzvjjd9g"></a>

\- Urgent Matters: 1 hour or less during working hours.

\- Non-Urgent Matters: 24 hours.

\- Outside Working Hours: Responses can wait until the next business day unless previously agreed upon.

### What Should Be Communicated: <a href="#id-53u0ji8z5sqf" id="id-53u0ji8z5sqf"></a>

\- Quick Questions or Clarifications: "Is the bug fix in the latest commit ready for QA?"

\- Immediate Updates: "The CI/CD pipeline failed—I'm investigating now."

\- Informal Communication: "Good morning team! Quick reminder to review the latest pull requests."

\- Time-Sensitive Alerts: "Reminder: Code freeze is in two hours."

### What Should Not Be Communicated: <a href="#q870qvxpimza" id="q870qvxpimza"></a>

\- Task Assignments or Detailed Project Updates: These should go in ClickUp to ensure proper tracking.

\- Long-Form Discussions or Decisions: Such discussions should be moved to ClickUp or GitBook if they require documentation or extended analysis.

\- Examples:

\- Appropriate Slack Message: "Hey team, I'm noticing slower-than-usual load times on the staging environment—anyone else seeing this?"

\- Inappropriate Slack Message: "Can everyone update the sprint board with their current progress?" (This should be in ClickUp.)

### 2. Task Tracker: ClickUp <a href="#z2917rhszepw" id="z2917rhszepw"></a>

### Purpose: <a href="#t7tst7pehd2x" id="t7tst7pehd2x"></a>

ClickUp is our centralized platform for managing tasks, projects, and workflows. It is essential for tracking progress, assigning responsibilities, and ensuring that everyone is aligned on priorities and deadlines.

### Acceptable Response Time: <a href="#ye5pid47c9zv" id="ye5pid47c9zv"></a>

\- Task Updates: Within 24 hours of task assignment or status change.

\- Comments or Requests for Clarification on Tasks: 24-48 hours, depending on the urgency.

### What Should Be Communicated: <a href="#p5wcs26xqatj" id="p5wcs26xqatj"></a>

\- Task Assignments: "Implement the new authentication API by end of sprint."

\- Project Progress Updates: "User login feature is 80% complete—currently working on session handling."

\- Detailed Instructions or Specifications: "Use OAuth 2.0 for the API integration task."

\- Documentation of Decisions: "Decided to refactor the legacy codebase before adding new features."

### What Should Not Be Communicated: <a href="#id-17klgfuedamy" id="id-17klgfuedamy"></a>

\- Quick Clarifications or Immediate Responses: These should go on Slack if they require rapid feedback.

\- Casual or Informal Conversations: These should be kept to Slack or not communicated at all in ClickUp.

\- Examples:

\- Appropriate ClickUp Update: "Updated the task with the latest API documentation—please review before proceeding."

\- Inappropriate ClickUp Update: "Can someone quickly check if the new API endpoint is working?" (This should be on Slack.)

### 3. Handbook Documentation: GitBook <a href="#ydxe6s54tv57" id="ydxe6s54tv57"></a>

### Purpose: <a href="#tl3xojbxsf52" id="tl3xojbxsf52"></a>

GitBook serves as our single source of truth for all company documentation. It houses our handbook, policies, procedures, and any other vital information that team members need to access.

### Acceptable Response Time: <a href="#h4wxqz76xsdn" id="h4wxqz76xsdn"></a>

\- Updates or Additions: Within a week of a new policy or procedure being established.

\- Comments or Suggestions: These can be discussed in Slack or ClickUp before being formally documented in GitBook.

\- What Should Be Communicated:

\- Company Policies and Procedures: "The official process for code reviews has been updated."

\- Guidelines and Best Practices: "Here’s the standard for writing unit tests and documenting them."

\- Documented Decisions: "The decision to adopt React for the frontend is now documented."

\- Long-Term Reference Material: "The architecture of the new microservices is outlined here."

### What Should Not Be Communicated: <a href="#j9h8g8a72t9q" id="j9h8g8a72t9q"></a>

\- Temporary or Short-Term Updates: These belong in ClickUp or Slack.

\- Day-to-Day Task Updates: GitBook is for high-level documentation, not daily work tracking.

\- Examples:

\- Appropriate GitBook Entry: "Our new deployment strategy, including step-by-step instructions and rollback procedures, is documented here."

\- Inappropriate GitBook Entry: "Notes from today’s sprint planning meeting." (These should be kept in ClickUp or a dedicated shared document, not GitBook.)

By adhering to these guidelines and using the tools appropriately, we ensure that our communication remains effective, our tasks are well-managed, and our documentation is always up-to-date and accessible to all team members. This structured approach is crucial for maintaining the productivity and cohesiveness of our remote and asynchronous work environment at Exchequer.
