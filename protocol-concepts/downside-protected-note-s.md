# Downside Protected Note(s)

Exchequer supports two note types. Both are ERC-20s with **on-chain, transparent collateral** and a **downside protection floor at maturity**. They differ in whether the buyer receives **yield during the term** and how **upside** is synthesized.

## 1) Growth Downside-Protected Note (Growth D-Pro)

A Growth D-Pros delivers a **protection floor (max 75%)** plus **upside participation** during the term.  Returns (if any) are realized at **settlement** via the defined participation.

#### Creation Mechanism

1. **Issue Notes** — Project sells Growth D-Pros to buyers (ERC-20).
2. **Collateralize & Replicate** — Proceeds and treasury assets are posted on-chain to (a) **fund the floor**, and (b) **replicate spot-like upside** (no LP rebalancing).
3. **LP** — Project forms project-owned LP as part of the collateral plan.
4. **Settle** — At maturity, buyers receive **the floor or the specified upside payoff**, whichever is greater.

#### Features

* **Partial downside protection (≤75% drawdown floor)** settling in LP tokens.
* **No yield (zero coupon)**; simple buyer outcome at settlement.
* **No IL on the upside**—tracks token appreciation per participation/cap terms.
* **AMM-agnostic**; works alongside any major DEX without requiring emissions.
* **Issuer levers:** term, floor level, participation rate, optional upside cap.

**Typical fit:** **New-user acquisition** and conviction holders who want **clean “floor + upside”** instead of yield; ideal when minimizing complexity and **avoiding IL** is paramount.

## 2) Yield Downside-Protected Note (Yield D-Pro)

A Yield D-Pros represents a **collateralized LP position with a protection floor**. Buyers earn **trading-fee yield** during the term, and principal is protected **up to a 75% drawdown** at maturity via LP-token settlement. Upside comes via LP exposure and may experience **impermanent loss relative to pure spot** in strong rallies.

#### Creation Mechanism

1. **Issue Notes** — Project sells Yield D-Pros to buyers (ERC-20).
2. **Form LP** — Proceeds are **paired with treasury tokens** to mint a **project-owned LP position** on the chosen AMM.
3. **Accrue Yield** — **Trading fees** generated by the LP accrue per the note’s terms.
4. **Settle** — At maturity, buyers receive the **greater of** the protection floor or the value defined by the LP exposure per terms.

#### Features

* **Partial downside protection (≤75% drawdown floor)** settling in LP tokens.
* **Yield during the term** from LP trading fees.
* **AMM-native liquidity** as a by-product of issuance (deepens on-chain books).
* **Transparent, permissionless design** (no CEX/MM retainers or token loans).
* **Issuer levers:** term, floor level, AMM/pool selection, fee routing.

**Typical fit:** Yield-seeking users and teams that want to **buy on-chain liquidity** while avoiding opaque MM deals.
