## Whitepapers (Foundational Series)

#### 1) Evaluating Liquidity Provision Strategies for Automated Market Makers

**Why read:** When does AMM yield truly beat “just HODL”? This paper derives the hurdle where expected fees offset volatility drag (the impermanent-loss bite).\

#### 2) The LP Forward Contract: Quantifying Liquidity-Position Risk in DeFi

**Why read:** The first closed-form hedge for LP risk. Strips out AMM yield to price the pure “LP spot” via a forward—your building block for hedging desks.\

#### 3) Liquidity Position Options: Transforming DeFi with Novel Risk-Management Primitives

**Why read:** Introduces LP calls/puts and put-call parity for LPs (closed-form Black-Scholes after the power-½ transform). Enables IL caps, vol trading, and structured notes.\

#### 4) A Novel Financial Instrument for DeFi: Liquidity Protection Notes

**Why read:** Packages zero-coupon + LP options (+ optional yield) into a note format that funds **up to 75%** downside protection without inflationary emissions.\
