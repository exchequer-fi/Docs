# Note Quantity

**Note Quantity** refers to the total number of Liquidity Notes that a project creates and offers for sale to investors. Each note represents a proportional share of the liquidity pool and entitles the holder to specific benefits such as downside protection, yield distributions, and upside boosts.



## **Relation to Offering Size**

* **Offering Size** and **Note Quantity** are closely related but distinct concepts:
  * **Offering Size**: Refers to the total capital or liquidity being raised through the issuance of Liquidity Notes.
  * **Note Quantity**: Denotes the number of individual notes issued to represent that capital.
* **Example**:
  * **Offering Size**: $5,000,000 USDC
  * **Price per Liquidity Note**: $100 USDC
  * **Note Quantity**: 50,000 Liquidity Notes (since $5,000,000 / $100 = 50,000)

## **Representation in the Liquidity Pool**

* Each Liquidity Note corresponds to a specific portion of the total liquidity pool. The cumulative note quantity, multiplied by the price per note, should align with the total liquidity provided in the pool.
* **Example**:
  * **Note Quantity**: 50,000 Liquidity Notes
  * **Price per Note**: $100 USDC
  * **Total Liquidity Created**: 50,000 Ã— $100 = $5,000,000 USDC (from investors) + $5,000,000 USDC (from the project) = $10,000,000 USDC
