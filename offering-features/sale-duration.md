# Sale Duration

**Sale Duration** refers to the total timeframe from the commencement to the conclusion of the Liquidity Note offering. It dictates how long the Liquidity Notes will be available for investors to purchase.  The chosen sale duration affects the pace at which Liquidity Notes are sold, the urgency felt by investors, and the overall capital raised during the offering period.

## **Fixed Size Sale**

In a **Fixed Size Sale**, the sale duration determines how long the Liquidity Notes will be available at a fixed price. The entire offering is made available at a predetermined price for the specified duration, after which the sale concludes regardless of whether all Liquidity Notes have been sold.

* **Example Scenario**:
  * **Offering Size**: 50,000 Liquidity Notes
  * **Price per Liquidity Note**: 100 USDC
  * **Sale Duration**: 7 days
  * **Outcome**: Investors can purchase Liquidity Notes at 100 USDC each for a week. If only 30,000 notes are sold within this period, the remaining 20,000 notes are unsold after the sale ends.

## Considerations for Setting Sale Duration

When determining the appropriate sale duration for your Liquidity Note offering, consider the following factors:

1. **Market Demand and Investor Behavior**
   * **High Demand**: Shorter sale durations can capitalize on strong investor interest, creating urgency and maximizing participation within a limited timeframe.
   * **Steady or Low Demand**: Longer sale durations provide more time for marketing efforts to reach a broader audience and for investors to participate at their convenience.
2. **Regulatory and Compliance Considerations**
   * **Jurisdictional Regulations**: Some regions may impose restrictions on sale durations for financial instruments. Ensure compliance with local laws to avoid legal complications.
   * **Disclosure Requirements**: Longer durations may require more comprehensive disclosure and reporting to regulatory bodies.
3. **Competitive Landscape**
   * **Benchmarking**: Analyze how similar projects structure their sale durations. Aligning with industry standards can enhance competitiveness.
   * **Differentiation**: Offering unique sale durations or mechanisms can set the Liquidity Note apart in a crowded market.
4. **Economic and Market Conditions**
   * **Bullish Markets**: Shorter durations can leverage positive market sentiment and maximize capital raised.
   * **Bearish or Uncertain Markets**: Longer durations may provide the necessary flexibility to adapt to fluctuating market conditions and investor confidence levels.
