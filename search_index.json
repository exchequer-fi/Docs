Protocol Overview","keywords":"","body":"Exchequer Protocol Overview\nIntroduction\nThe Exchequer protocol is a peer-to-peer system designed for cryptocurrencies (ERC-20 Tokens) to build liquidity on any AMM (e.g. Uniswap, Balancer, Curve, etc...).  The protocol is implemented as a set of persistent, non-upgradeable smart contracts; designed to prioritize censorship resistance, security, self-custody, and to function without any trusted intermediaries.\nHow does the Exchequer protocol compare to traditional crypto liquidity building?\nThe core characteristic of an Automated Market Maker (AMM) is that buyers and sellers trade directly with a liquidity pool. The deeper the liquidity pool, the less slippage traders experience during transactions. Therefore, building deep liquidity on an AMM is crucial for any cryptocurrency.\nAfter the popularization of Automated Market Makers (AMMs) by Uniswap, token incentives became a common strategy for building liquidity pools. These incentives are used in two primary ways:\n1. On-Chain Yield farming\n\\\nCryptocurrencies can build liquidity directly on-chain by asking users to deposit assets into liquidity pools.  In return, users receive token rewards from the project's treasury, a method known as yield farming.\nExchequer Protocol takes a different approach. Instead of offering token incentives, project treasuries  insures the downside price risk of their cryptocurrency for a fixed period. This means that if the price of the project's cryptocurrency declines, liquidity providers receive either full or partial principal protection.\n2. Off-Chain Market Makers\n\\\nTraditionally, cryptocurrencies have engaged centralized market makers to build liquidity on AMMs or centralized exchanges (CEXs). Projects pay for these market-making services using tokens from their treasuries. Market makers often sell these tokens to make a profit.\nThe Exchequer Protocol offers a different approach. Its permissionless and immutable design allows cryptocurrencies to build liquidity transparently on-chain without intermediaries. This eliminates the need to issue token incentives or rely on centralized entities.\n"},"protocol-concepts/downside-protection.html":{"url":"protocol-concepts/downside-protection.html","title":"Downside Protection","keywords":"","body":"Downside Protection\nIntroduction\nThe defining idea of Exchequer Protocol is downside protection:  Instead of compensating users for providing liquidity through token incentives, Exchequer allows projects to reduces risk by insuring the downside for liquidity providers.\nFor many cryptocurrencies, the risks associated with providing liquidity in an AMM liquidity pool are not justified by the trading yields obtained. Consequently, project treasuries often need to:\n\nEngage Centralized Market Makers\nConduct Yield Farming Campaigns\n\nHowever, token incentives can create a PvP (Player vs. Player) scenario, where your profit and loss (PnL) as a liquidity provider is directly impacted by when you sell your tokens. This dynamic often results in a significant portion of liquidity providers incurring losses.\nExchequer Protocol offers a different approach. By providing downside protection, project treasuries insure liquidity providers against price declines of their cryptocurrency over a fixed period. This means:\n\nNo Token Incentives to Sell: Eliminating the need to issue additional tokens reduces sell pressure and avoids diluting token value.\nElimination of PvP Market Structures: With downside protection in place, liquidity providers are less likely to lose money, fostering a more cooperative and stable ecosystem.\n\nLP collateral\nTo make downside protection both permissionless and trustless, it's essential to have collateral that underwrites the protection.

This method is suitable when the project has a clear understanding of the token's price, as it requires setting an explicit price for the notes. It is also effective when there is confidence in the demand for the Liquidity Notes, reducing the need to allocate additional resources to generate interest through the sale process itself.\n\nAuction\nAlternatively, Liquidity Notes can be sold via an auction. This approach allows the market to determine the price based on current supply and demand dynamics. Auctions are beneficial when the token's price is uncertain or when the project aims to stimulate demand and engage participants through competitive bidding and speculation.\n\n\nConsiderations for Determining Whether to Use a Fixed Size or an Auction to Issue a Liquidity Note\nEach approach has distinct advantages and considerations that can significantly impact the success of the offering. This section outlines the key factors to consider when choosing between a fixed size sale and an auction for selling Liquidity Notes, supported by numerical examples.\n\nMarket Demand and Investor Behavior\nAssessment: Understand the current demand for Liquidity Notes and the investment behavior of your target audience.\nImpact:\nHigh Demand: An auction can capitalize on strong investor interest by allowing prices to adjust based on real-time bidding.\nSteady or Uncertain Demand: A fixed size sale provides predictability and simplicity, which can be more appealing to a broader range of investors.\n\n\n\n\nPrice Discovery Needs\nAssessment: Determine whether the project requires a flexible pricing mechanism that reflects market sentiment.\nImpact:\nDynamic Pricing: Auctions facilitate natural price discovery, ensuring that the price of Liquidity Notes aligns with current market conditions and investor willingness to pay.\nStable Pricing: Fixed size sales offer a set price, which can simplify the investment process but may not fully capture the asset's market value.\n\n\n\n\nLiquidity Pool Goals\nAssessment: Evaluate how the chosen sale mechanism aligns with the goals for the liquidity pool’s size and composition.\nImpact:\nTargeted Liquidity Levels: Fixed size sales help maintain controlled liquidity levels by limiting the number of Liquidity Notes issued.\nScalable Liquidity: Auctions can dynamically adjust the liquidity pool size based on real-time investor participation, fostering scalability.\n\n\n\n\n\nPros and Cons\nFixed Size Sale\n\n\n\nPros\nCons\n\n\n\n\nPredictable capital raising\nPotential for underselling if demand is high\n\n\nSimplicity and ease of participation\nFixed price may not reflect true market value\n\n\nClear offering parameters\nLimited flexibility in response to market changes\n\n\n\nAuction\n\n\n\nPros\nCons\n\n\n\n\nMarket-driven pricing and higher potential returns\nIncreased complexity\n\n\nAbility to capture higher demand\nUncertainty in total capital raised\n\n\nFlexibility to adjust based on investor interest\nPotential for volatility in final pricing\n\n\nEnhanced price discovery\nMore complex for investors to participate\n\n\n\n"},"protocol-concepts/yield-distribution.html":{"url":"protocol-concepts/yield-distribution.html","title":"Yield Distribution","keywords":"","body":"Yield Distribution\nLiquidity Notes are yield-bearing primitives because they are collateralized by Liquidity Provider (LP) tokens. These LP tokens generate yield in the form of trading fees from the underlying liquidity pool. The handling of these trading fees can be configured in two ways:\n\nAutomatic Accrual to the LP Position (Uniswap V2 Style)\nIn this configuration, trading fees are automatically reinvested into the LP position. The value of the LP tokens increases over time as fees are accrued, enhancing the overall yield of the Liquidity Notes without requiring manual intervention.\n\n\nManual Claiming of Trading Fees (Uniswap V3 Style)\nAlternatively, trading fees are set aside separately from the LP position. Holders of Liquidity Notes can manually claim these accumulated fees at their discretion. This approach provides more control over the timing of fee collection but requires active management by the investor.\n\n\n\nConfiguring Yield Distribution between Project and Investor\nCryptocurrency projects have the flexibility to determine how much of the yield from Liquidity Notes is allocated to note holders. This is achieved by configuring the percentage of trading fees earned by the underlying LP collateral that is passed on to the Liquidity Note holders.\nExample Scenario\nConsider the following example to illustrate how yield distribution can be configured:\n\nInitial Investment and Collateral Formation\nUser Investment: A user purchases a Liquidity Note for 100 USDC.\nLP Collateral Composition: The Liquidity Note is backed by an LP position valued at 200 USDC, consisting of:\n100 USDC from the user's purchase.\n100 USDC worth of TOKEN contributed by the project's treasury.\n\n\n\n\nDefault Yield Configuration\nYield Allocation: The default setting allocates trading fees based on 100% of the Liquidity Note's initial value (i.e., the user's 100 USDC investment).\nDistribution Outcome:\nThe user receives trading fees corresponding to 50% of the total LP collateral (their proportion of the investment).\nThe project retains the remaining 50% of the trading fees, corresponding to the TOKEN it contributed.\n\n\n\n\nAlternative Yield Configuration\nEnhanced Yield Allocation: The project can configure the Liquidity Note to provide up to 200% of the yield based on the Liquidity Note's initial value.\nDistribution Outcome:\nThe user receives trading fees from the entire 200 USDC LP collateral.\nThis means the user gains 100% of the trading fees generated by the LP position.\nThe project does not retain any portion of the trading fees in this configuration.\n\n\n\n\n\nConsiderations for Determining the Level of Yield Distribution in a Liquidity Note\nWhen configuring a Liquidity Note, one of the essential parameters to establish is the level of yield distribution. This determines how the trading fees generated by the underlying Liquidity Provider (LP) collateral are allocated between the Liquidity Note holders and the project. Setting an appropriate yield distribution level is crucial for balancing investor returns, project sustainability, and overall market attractiveness.\nKey Considerations\n\nInvestor Expectations and Incentives\nAssessment: Understand what investors seek in terms of returns and risk mitigation.\nImpact: Competitive yield distributions can make Liquidity Notes more attractive, increasing demand and participation.\nExample: If comparable liquidity notes in the market offer around 120% yield distribution, setting a similar or slightly higher percentage (e.g., 125%) can enhance the Liquidity Note’s appeal.\n\n\nYield Sustainability and LP Collateral Performance\nAssessment: Evaluate the historical and projected performance of the LP collateral in generating trading fees.\nImpact: Ensuring that the yield distribution level is sustainable based on the LP collateral’s performance prevents overcommitment and maintains project viability.\nExample: If the LP collateral consistently generates an average of 20% annual yield, distributing 120% (24% APY) to investors ensures that the project retains 16% APY for its obligations and reserves.\n\n\nBalancing Downside Protection, Upside Boost and Yield Distribution\nAssessment: Determine how yield distribution interacts with downside protection and yield boost mechanisms.\nImpact: Higher yield distributions may necessitate downward adjustments in downside protection and yield boost levels to maintain financial balance and project obligations.\nExample: Offering a high yield distribution of 200% might require the project to set a moderate downside protection level (e.g., 20%) to ensure that both investor returns and protection are adequately funded.\n\n\nMarket Conditions and Competitive Landscape\nAssessment: Analyze current market trends, competitor offerings, and overall demand for liquidity instruments.\nImpact: Aligning yield distribution levels with market standards ensures competitiveness and relevance.\nExample: In a bullish market with high investor interest, a project might increase yield distribution to capture more capital, whereas in a bearish or uncertain market, maintaining a stable or slightly lower distribution can preserve investor confidence without overextending obligations.\n\n\nRegulatory and Compliance Considerations\nAssessment: Ensure that yield distribution practices comply with relevant financial regulations and standards.\nImpact: Adhering to regulatory requirements avoids legal complications and fosters trust among investors.\nExample: Some jurisdictions may have caps on yield distributions or specific disclosure requirements, influencing the maximum feasible distribution level.\n\n\n\n"},"protocol-concepts/upside-boost.html":{"url":"protocol-concepts/upside-boost.html","title":"Upside Boost","keywords":"","body":"Upside Boost\nUpside Boost is a feature that allows a cryptocurrency project to provide Liquidity Note holders with additional upside potential beyond what they would normally receive from the underlying LP collateral.

This is the point at which a Liquidity Note reaches the end of its lifecycle, and several key actions take place:\n\nExpiration of Downside Protection: The downside protection feature of the Liquidity Note ceases upon maturity. This means that any safeguards against price decreases in the underlying cryptocurrency are no longer in effect after this date.\nRedemption Opportunity: Holders have the option to redeem their Liquidity Notes. Redemption involves exchanging the note for the underlying assets, typically the Liquidity Provider (LP) collateral, which can then be converted into the constituent cryptocurrencies if desired.\nRollover Option: Alternatively, the project may offer a rollover into a new Liquidity Note with a new maturity date and potentially different terms, such as adjusted levels of downside protection, upside potential, and yield distribution. Holders can choose to accept this rollover or proceed with redemption.\n\nPurpose\n\nCustomization: Fixed maturity dates allow projects to tailor each Liquidity Note to specific needs and prevailing market conditions. By setting a maturity date, projects can adjust features like downside protection and yield to align with strategic objectives.\nRisk Management: Maturity provides a clear timeframe for both the project and investors to assess and manage risks. Investors know the duration of their protection and benefits, enabling informed decision-making.\nFlexibility: At maturity, both parties have the opportunity to renegotiate terms or exit the agreement, offering flexibility in investment strategies.\n\nConsiderations for Determining the Maturity to Set on a Liquidity Note\nSelecting an appropriate maturity duration involves balancing various factors to align with both the project's objectives and investor expectations. \nKey Considerations\n\nMarket Volatility of the Underlying Token\nAssessment: Evaluate the historical and anticipated volatility of the underlying token.\nImpact: Highly volatile tokens may require shorter maturity periods to mitigate extended exposure to market fluctuations, while more stable tokens can support longer durations.\nExample: A token with monthly price swings of ±25% might benefit from a 3-month maturity to limit prolonged downside exposure, whereas a token with monthly swings of ±5% could accommodate a 12-month+ maturity.\n\n\nProject’s Financial Objectives and Roadmap\nAssessment: Align the maturity period with the project's financial goals and developmental milestones.\nImpact: Shorter maturities can provide more frequent capital recycling for project initiatives, while longer maturities offer sustained liquidity support.\nExample: A project planning quarterly feature releases may opt for 3-month maturities to align liquidity provision with development cycles. Conversely, a project focused on long-term ecosystem growth might choose 12-month maturities to ensure continuous liquidity support.\n\n\nInvestor Preferences and Risk Tolerance\nAssessment: Understand the target investors’ preferences regarding investment horizons and risk profiles.\nImpact: Offering a range of maturities can cater to different investor segments, enhancing overall participation and satisfaction.\nExample: Institutional investors might prefer longer maturities (e.g., 12 months) for stable, long-term returns, while retail investors might favor shorter maturities (e.g., 6 months) for quicker liquidity and reduced exposure duration.\n\n\nLiquidity Pool Dynamics and Yield Sustainability\nAssessment: Analyze the liquidity pool’s capacity to generate sustainable yields over different timeframes.\nImpact: Ensuring that the liquidity pool can consistently support yield distribution throughout the maturity period is essential for maintaining investor trust and financial stability.\nExample: A liquidity pool generating a steady 10% APY might sustain a 12-month maturity, whereas a pool with fluctuating yields may be better suited to shorter maturities to adapt to changing conditions.\n\n\nRegulatory and Compliance Requirements\nAssessment: Ensure that the chosen maturity period complies with relevant financial regulations and standards in applicable jurisdictions.\nImpact: Regulatory constraints may influence the permissible range of maturity periods or require specific disclosures based on duration.\nExample: Certain jurisdictions might mandate maximum or minimum maturity periods for financial instruments like Liquidity Notes, necessitating adherence to these guidelines during configuration.\n\n\n\n"},"note-features/upside-boost.html":{"url":"note-features/upside-boost.html","title":"Upside Boost","keywords":"","body":"Upside Boost\nUpside Boost is a feature that allows a cryptocurrency project to provide Liquidity Note holders with additional upside potential beyond what they would normally receive from the underlying LP collateral.

This dynamic often results in a significant portion of liquidity providers incurring losses.\nExchequer Protocol offers a different approach. By providing downside protection, project treasuries insure liquidity providers against price declines of their cryptocurrency over a fixed period. This means:\n\nNo Token Incentives to Sell: Eliminating the need to issue additional tokens reduces sell pressure and avoids diluting token value.\nElimination of PvP Market Structures: With downside protection in place, liquidity providers are less likely to lose money, fostering a more cooperative and stable ecosystem.\n\nLP collateral\nTo make downside protection both permissionless and trustless, it's essential to have collateral that underwrites the protection. In the Exchequer Protocol, the liquidity pool itself serves as the collateral.\nCollateral Composition\n\nProject Treasury Contribution (50%)\nThe project's treasury contributes its own cryptocurrency to the liquidity pool.\nThis portion is used to insure the downside risk of the asset.\n\n\nUser Contribution (50%)\nUsers contribute stablecoins or ETH to the liquidity pool.\nThis represents the user's stake and potential exposure.\n\n\n\nTypically, the liquidity pool is a uniformly distributed full-range pool, meaning assets are available across all price ranges within the AMM.\nMechanism for Trustless Downside Protection\nFor downside protection to be trustlessly ensured, the total value of the collateral must exceed the value of the cryptocurrency contributed by the user. This guarantees that:\n\nSufficient Coverage: In the event of a price decline, there's enough collateral to provide partial principal protection to the user.\nElimination of Counterparty Risk: Since the collateral is on-chain and locked within the liquidity pool, users don't need to trust a third party to honor the protection.\nPermissionless Access: Any user can participate without needing approval from intermediaries.\n\nCalculating Protection vs Collateral\nTo illustrate how the Exchequer Protocol provides downside protection, let's walk through an example.\nInitial Setup\n\nUser Contribution: 100 USDC\nProject Contribution: 100 TOKEN\nInitial TOKEN Price: 1 USDC per TOKEN\nLiquidity Pool Composition:\n100 USDC (from the user)\n100 TOKEN (from the project)\n\n\nTotal Pool Value: 200 USDC\n\nThe liquidity pool is a uniformly distributed full-range pool, meaning assets are available across all price ranges within the AMM.\nScenario: TOKEN Price Declines by 75%\n\nNew TOKEN Price: 0.25 USDC per TOKEN\nValue of TOKEN in Pool: 200 TOKEN × 0.25 USDC = 50 USDC\nValue of USDC in Pool: 50 USDC\nTotal Pool Value: 50 USDC (from TOKEN) + 50 USDC = 100 USDC\n\n*To DIY calculate see \"Impermanent Loss Calculator\", understand the maths see, Uniswap V2 documentation on \"Understanding Returns\".\nImpact on the User\nUnder normal circumstances, the user would suffer a loss due to the price decline. However, with the Exchequer Protocol's downside protection:\n\nMaximum Downside Protection Offered: 75%\nUser's Initial Contribution: 100 USDC\nProtected Amount: Up to 75% price decline\n\nSince the TOKEN price declined by exactly 75%, the protocol ensures that the user can redeem their full principal of 100 USDC upon withdrawal.\nThe liquidity pool's assets act as collateral to secure the user's principal.\nConsiderations for Determining the Level of Downside Protection in a Liquidity Note\nWhen configuring a Liquidity Note, one of the critical parameters to define is the level of downside protection offered to investors. \n\nRisk Appetite of the Project\nAssessment: Determine the project's willingness to assume financial risk in providing downside protection.\nImpact: Higher downside protection levels increase the project's financial obligations, requiring a robust treasury to cover potential losses.\nExample: A project with a strong treasury may opt for 75% downside protection, while a project with limited reserves might choose a lower protection level, such as 20%.\n\n\nMarket Volatility of the Underlying Token\nAssessment: Analyze the historical and expected volatility of the underlying token.\nImpact: Higher volatility may necessitate higher downside protection to attract risk-averse investors.\nExample: If the underlying token has exhibited monthly price swings of ±20%, offering 70% downside protection can provide a safety buffer for investors.\n\n\nInvestor Demand and Expectations\nAssessment: Gauge investor preferences and the competitive landscape of similar cryptocurrencies.\nImpact: Aligning downside protection levels with investor expectations can enhance the attractiveness of the Liquidity Notes.\nExample: If other competitor cryptocurrencies offer 60% downside protection, setting a similar or slightly higher protection level (e.g., 70%) can position the project favorably in the market.\n\n\nYield Distribution and Upside Boost Configuration\nAssessment: Balance downside protection with other features like yield distribution and upside boost.\nImpact: Higher downside protection may mean adjustments to be more conservative in yield distribution or upside boost.\nExample: Offering 70% downside protection might be paired with a 20% upside boost, ensuring that the project's obligations remain manageable while providing attractive returns to investors.\n\n\nRegulatory and Compliance Factors\nAssessment: Consider legal and regulatory requirements governing financial instruments and protections in relevant jurisdictions.\nImpact: Compliance with regulations may dictate minimum or maximum levels of protection that can be offered.\nExample: Regulatory guidelines might require a minimum of 50% downside protection, influencing the project's configuration choices.\n\n\n\n"},"note-features/safety-margin.html":{"url":"note-features/safety-margin.html","title":"Safety Margin","keywords":"","body":"Safety Margin\nThe safety margin is a specific price of the underlying cryptocurrency that determines how the downside protection mechanism applies.\nMechanics\n\nFull Protection Above the Safety Margin: As long as the token's price remains above the safety margin, any decrease in price does not affect the investor's principal. The Liquidity Note absorbs all losses up to this point.\nPartial Protection Below the Safety Margin: If the token's price falls below the safety margin, the investor starts to experience losses. However, due to the partial protection provided by the Liquidity Note, these losses are less severe than they would be if the investor held the cryptocurrency directly.\n\nExample Scenario\n\nInitial Conditions\nToken Price at Issuance: The token is priced at $1 when the Liquidity Note is issued.\nDownside Protection Level: The Liquidity Note offers protection for the first 50% of price decline.\nSafety Margin Price: $0.50 (which is 50% below the initial price).\n\n\n\n\nPrice Movements and Impact on the Investor\nPrice Drops to $0.90\nOutcome: Price is above the safety margin ($0.90 > $0.50).\nInvestor's Loss: $0.

These LP tokens generate yield in the form of trading fees from the underlying liquidity pool. The handling of these trading fees can be configured in two ways:\n\nAutomatic Accrual to the LP Position (Uniswap V2 Style)\nIn this configuration, trading fees are automatically reinvested into the LP position. The value of the LP tokens increases over time as fees are accrued, enhancing the overall yield of the Liquidity Notes without requiring manual intervention.\n\n\nManual Claiming of Trading Fees (Uniswap V3 Style)\nAlternatively, trading fees are set aside separately from the LP position. Holders of Liquidity Notes can manually claim these accumulated fees at their discretion. This approach provides more control over the timing of fee collection but requires active management by the investor.\n\n\n\nConfiguring Yield Distribution between Project and Investor\nCryptocurrency projects have the flexibility to determine how much of the yield from Liquidity Notes is allocated to note holders. This is achieved by configuring the percentage of trading fees earned by the underlying LP collateral that is passed on to the Liquidity Note holders.\nExample Scenario\nConsider the following example to illustrate how yield distribution can be configured:\n\nInitial Investment and Collateral Formation\nUser Investment: A user purchases a Liquidity Note for 100 USDC.\nLP Collateral Composition: The Liquidity Note is backed by an LP position valued at 200 USDC, consisting of:\n100 USDC from the user's purchase.\n100 USDC worth of TOKEN contributed by the project's treasury.\n\n\n\n\nDefault Yield Configuration\nYield Allocation: The default setting allocates trading fees based on 100% of the Liquidity Note's initial value (i.e., the user's 100 USDC investment).\nDistribution Outcome:\nThe user receives trading fees corresponding to 50% of the total LP collateral (their proportion of the investment).\nThe project retains the remaining 50% of the trading fees, corresponding to the TOKEN it contributed.\n\n\n\n\nAlternative Yield Configuration\nEnhanced Yield Allocation: The project can configure the Liquidity Note to provide up to 200% of the yield based on the Liquidity Note's initial value.\nDistribution Outcome:\nThe user receives trading fees from the entire 200 USDC LP collateral.\nThis means the user gains 100% of the trading fees generated by the LP position.\nThe project does not retain any portion of the trading fees in this configuration.\n\n\n\n\n\nConsiderations for Determining the Level of Yield Distribution in a Liquidity Note\nWhen configuring a Liquidity Note, one of the essential parameters to establish is the level of yield distribution. This determines how the trading fees generated by the underlying Liquidity Provider (LP) collateral are allocated between the Liquidity Note holders and the project. Setting an appropriate yield distribution level is crucial for balancing investor returns, project sustainability, and overall market attractiveness.\nKey Considerations\n\nInvestor Expectations and Incentives\nAssessment: Understand what investors seek in terms of returns and risk mitigation.\nImpact: Competitive yield distributions can make Liquidity Notes more attractive, increasing demand and participation.\nExample: If comparable liquidity notes in the market offer around 120% yield distribution, setting a similar or slightly higher percentage (e.g., 125%) can enhance the Liquidity Note’s appeal.\n\n\nYield Sustainability and LP Collateral Performance\nAssessment: Evaluate the historical and projected performance of the LP collateral in generating trading fees.\nImpact: Ensuring that the yield distribution level is sustainable based on the LP collateral’s performance prevents overcommitment and maintains project viability.\nExample: If the LP collateral consistently generates an average of 20% annual yield, distributing 120% (24% APY) to investors ensures that the project retains 16% APY for its obligations and reserves.\n\n\nBalancing Downside Protection, Upside Boost and Yield Distribution\nAssessment: Determine how yield distribution interacts with downside protection and yield boost mechanisms.\nImpact: Higher yield distributions may necessitate downward adjustments in downside protection and yield boost levels to maintain financial balance and project obligations.\nExample: Offering a high yield distribution of 200% might require the project to set a moderate downside protection level (e.g., 20%) to ensure that both investor returns and protection are adequately funded.\n\n\nMarket Conditions and Competitive Landscape\nAssessment: Analyze current market trends, competitor offerings, and overall demand for liquidity instruments.\nImpact: Aligning yield distribution levels with market standards ensures competitiveness and relevance.\nExample: In a bullish market with high investor interest, a project might increase yield distribution to capture more capital, whereas in a bearish or uncertain market, maintaining a stable or slightly lower distribution can preserve investor confidence without overextending obligations.\n\n\nRegulatory and Compliance Considerations\nAssessment: Ensure that yield distribution practices comply with relevant financial regulations and standards.\nImpact: Adhering to regulatory requirements avoids legal complications and fosters trust among investors.\nExample: Some jurisdictions may have caps on yield distributions or specific disclosure requirements, influencing the maximum feasible distribution level.\n\n\n\n"},"note-features/7-day-yield.html":{"url":"note-features/7-day-yield.html","title":"7-Day Yield","keywords":"","body":"7-Day Yield\nThe 7-day yield is an annualized percentage yield (APY) that represents the estimated annual return based on the trading fees collected over the previous seven days.

Ensure compliance with local laws to avoid legal complications.\nDisclosure Requirements: Longer durations may require more comprehensive disclosure and reporting to regulatory bodies.\n\n\nCompetitive Landscape\nBenchmarking: Analyze how similar projects structure their sale durations. Aligning with industry standards can enhance competitiveness.\nDifferentiation: Offering unique sale durations or mechanisms can set the Liquidity Note apart in a crowded market.\n\n\nEconomic and Market Conditions\nBullish Markets: Shorter durations can leverage positive market sentiment and maximize capital raised.\nBearish or Uncertain Markets: Longer durations may provide the necessary flexibility to adapt to fluctuating market conditions and investor confidence levels.\n\n\n\n"},"offering-features/offering-type.html":{"url":"offering-features/offering-type.html","title":"Offering Type","keywords":"","body":"Offering Type\nLiquidity Notes can be sold to users through two primary mechanisms:\n\nFixed Price Sale\nIn a fixed price sale, Liquidity Notes are offered at a predetermined price. This method is suitable when the project has a clear understanding of the token's price, as it requires setting an explicit price for the notes. It is also effective when there is confidence in the demand for the Liquidity Notes, reducing the need to allocate additional resources to generate interest through the sale process itself.\n\nAuction\nAlternatively, Liquidity Notes can be sold via an auction. This approach allows the market to determine the price based on current supply and demand dynamics. Auctions are beneficial when the token's price is uncertain or when the project aims to stimulate demand and engage participants through competitive bidding and speculation.\n\n\nConsiderations for Determining Whether to Use a Fixed Size or an Auction to Issue a Liquidity Note\nEach approach has distinct advantages and considerations that can significantly impact the success of the offering. This section outlines the key factors to consider when choosing between a fixed size sale and an auction for selling Liquidity Notes, supported by numerical examples.\n\nMarket Demand and Investor Behavior\nAssessment: Understand the current demand for Liquidity Notes and the investment behavior of your target audience.\nImpact:\nHigh Demand: An auction can capitalize on strong investor interest by allowing prices to adjust based on real-time bidding.\nSteady or Uncertain Demand: A fixed size sale provides predictability and simplicity, which can be more appealing to a broader range of investors.\n\n\n\n\nPrice Discovery Needs\nAssessment: Determine whether the project requires a flexible pricing mechanism that reflects market sentiment.\nImpact:\nDynamic Pricing: Auctions facilitate natural price discovery, ensuring that the price of Liquidity Notes aligns with current market conditions and investor willingness to pay.\nStable Pricing: Fixed size sales offer a set price, which can simplify the investment process but may not fully capture the asset's market value.\n\n\n\n\nLiquidity Pool Goals\nAssessment: Evaluate how the chosen sale mechanism aligns with the goals for the liquidity pool’s size and composition.\nImpact:\nTargeted Liquidity Levels: Fixed size sales help maintain controlled liquidity levels by limiting the number of Liquidity Notes issued.\nScalable Liquidity: Auctions can dynamically adjust the liquidity pool size based on real-time investor participation, fostering scalability.\n\n\n\n\n\nPros and Cons\nFixed Size Sale\n\n\n\nPros\nCons\n\n\n\n\nPredictable capital raising\nPotential for underselling if demand is high\n\n\nSimplicity and ease of participation\nFixed price may not reflect true market value\n\n\nClear offering parameters\nLimited flexibility in response to market changes\n\n\n\nAuction\n\n\n\nPros\nCons\n\n\n\n\nMarket-driven pricing and higher potential returns\nIncreased complexity\n\n\nAbility to capture higher demand\nUncertainty in total capital raised\n\n\nFlexibility to adjust based on investor interest\nPotential for volatility in final pricing\n\n\nEnhanced price discovery\nMore complex for investors to participate\n\n\n\n"},"offering-features/offering-price.html":{"url":"offering-features/offering-price.html","title":"Offering Price","keywords":"","body":"Offering Price\nOffering Price represents the price at which investors can purchase the Liquidity Note, distinct from the price of the underlying token. While benchmarking the offering price to match the token’s current market price is recommended for simplicity and transparency, there are special circumstances where the offering price may deviate either higher or lower. This section delves into the intricacies of setting the offering price, the rationale behind benchmarking, and the conditions that may warrant price adjustments.\nBenchmarking Offering Price to Token Price\nBenchmarking the offering price to the underlying token’s current market price offers several advantages:\n\nSimplicity: Aligning the two prices simplifies the investment decision for investors, who can easily correlate the Liquidity Note’s cost with their understanding of the token’s value.\nTransparency: Provides a clear and straightforward valuation basis, enhancing investor trust and confidence.\nMarket Alignment: Ensures that the Liquidity Note is competitively priced relative to the token’s market performance, preventing mispricing that could deter investment.\n\nExample:\n\nUnderlying Token Price: $50 per TOKEN\nOffering Price of Liquidity Note: $50 per Liquidity Note\nOutcome: Investors can directly relate the cost of the Liquidity Note to the token’s value, simplifying their investment analysis.\n\nConsideration for Price Variation\nWhile benchmarking is advisable, certain special circumstances may necessitate setting the offering price higher or lower than the underlying token’s market price. These adjustments aim to address specific project goals, market conditions, or investor incentives.\n1. Market Conditions\n\nBullish Markets:\nScenario: During periods of high market optimism and rapid token price appreciation.\nAdjustment: Setting the offering price slightly higher to capitalize on increased investor demand and maximize capital raised.\nExample: If TOKEN is priced at $50 but experiencing a bullish trend, the offering price might be set at $55 to reflect heightened market enthusiasm.\n\n\nBearish or Volatile Markets:\nScenario: In uncertain or declining market conditions.\nAdjustment: Setting the offering price lower to attract investors by offering a discount relative to the current token price, compensating for increased risk.\nExample: If TOKEN is priced at $50 but facing downward pressure, the offering price might be set at $45 to incentivize investment despite market downturns.\n\n\n\n2. Incentivizing Early Investors\n\nScenario: To reward early adopters and generate initial traction.\nAdjustment: Offering the Liquidity Note at a discounted price compared to the token’s market value.\nExample: Launching a Liquidity Note with an offering price of $40 when TOKEN is valued at $50, providing a 20% discount for early participants.\n\n3. Regulatory and Compliance Requirements\n\nScenario: Adhering to regulatory standards that may influence pricing structures.\nAdjustment: Modifying the offering price to comply with jurisdiction-specific financial regulations or investment caps.\nExample: Certain regulations may require a minimum offering price to classify the Liquidity Note as a specific financial instrument, necessitating an increase above the token’s market price.\n\n"},"offering-features/note-quantity.html":{"url":"offering-features/note-quantity.html","title":"Note Quantity","keywords":"","body":"Note Quantity\nNote Quantity refers to the total number of Liquidity Notes that a project creates and offers for sale to investors. Each note represents a proportional share of the liquidity pool and entitles the holder to specific benefits such as downside protection, yield distributions, and upside boosts.\nRelation to Offering Size\n\nOffering Size and Note Quantity are closely related but distinct concepts:\nOffering Size: Refers to the total capital or liquidity being raised through the issuance of Liquidity Notes.\nNote Quantity: Denotes the number of individual notes issued to represent that capital.\n\n\nExample:\nOffering Size: $5,000,000 USDC\nPrice per Liquidity Note: $100 USDC\nNote Quantity: 50,000 Liquidity Notes (since $5,000,000 / $100 = 50,000)\n\n\n\nRepresentation in the Liquidity Pool\n\nEach Liquidity Note corresponds to a specific portion of the total liquidity pool. The cumulative note quantity, multiplied by the price per note, should align with the total liquidity provided in the pool.\nExample:\nNote Quantity: 50,000 Liquidity Notes\nPrice per Note: $100 USDC\nTotal Liquidity Created: 50,000 × $100 = $5,000,000 USDC (from investors) + $5,000,000 USDC (from the project) = $10,000,000 USDC\n\n\n\n"},"signaling-features/intended-investment.html":{"url":"signaling-features/intended-investment.html","title":"Intended Investment","keywords":"","body":"Intended Investment\n"},"signaling-features/signal-interest.html":{"url":"signaling-features/signal-interest.html","title":"Signal Interest","keywords":"","body":"Signal Interest\n"},"redemption-features/note-extension.html":{"url":"redemption-features/note-extension.html","title":"Note Extension","keywords":"","body":"Note Extension\nNote Extension is a mechanism that enables cryptocurrency projects to offer existing Liquidity Note holders the opportunity to convert their current Liquidity Notes into new ones. This process allows existing holders to roll over their notes into the new issuance under more favorable terms than those available to new Liquidity Note buyers.\nBenefits of Note Extensions\n\nInvestor Retention: Encourages existing investors to continue their participation, reducing churn and fostering long-term engagement.\nEnhanced Trust: Demonstrates the project’s commitment to rewarding loyal investors, building trust and credibility within the community.\nStable Liquidity: Maintains or increases the liquidity pool size by converting existing investments, ensuring ongoing market stability and reduced slippage.\nOptimized Fundraising: Allows projects to strategically manage fundraising efforts by balancing new investor influx with existing investor loyalty.\n\nConsiderations for Varying Note Terms from the Original Note\nWhen extending a Liquidity Note and varying its terms from the original offering, projects must carefully evaluate several factors to maintain investor trust, regulatory compliance, and financial sustainability. Below are key considerations:\n\nInvestor Communication and Transparency\nImportance: Clear and transparent communication is crucial to inform existing and potential investors about changes in terms.\nAction: Provide detailed explanations for the extension and any modifications to the Liquidity Note terms through official channels such as the project website, newsletters, and community forums.\nExample: Announce the extension along with reasons (e.g., unmet fundraising goals) and outline any new terms, such as adjusted yield distributions or extended maturity dates.\n\n\nRegulatory Compliance\nImportance: Ensuring that any changes comply with relevant financial regulations to avoid legal complications.\nAction: Consult with legal experts to verify that extended terms adhere to jurisdiction-specific laws and regulations governing financial instruments.\nExample: If extending the sale duration requires additional disclosures or changes to the investment structure, ensure these are implemented in accordance with regulatory standards.\n\n\nMarket Conditions and Timing\nImportance: Aligning the extension and term variations with current market dynamics to maximize effectiveness.\nAction: Analyze market trends to determine the optimal timing for extending the Liquidity Note and adjust terms in a way that aligns with investor sentiment and market performance.\nExample: If the market is recovering from a downturn, extending the sale duration while offering more attractive yield distributions can attract investors looking to re-enter the market.\n\n\nCompetitive Landscape\nImportance: Ensuring that the extended Liquidity Note remains competitive compared to similar offerings in the market.\nAction: Benchmark against competitors to adjust terms in a way that enhances the Liquidity Note’s attractiveness without overextending the project’s obligations.\nExample: If competitors offer higher upside boosts, the project might consider increasing its own boost levels during the extension to remain competitive.\n\n\n\n"},"redemption-features/note-redemption.html":{"url":"redemption-features/note-redemption.html","title":"Note Redemption","keywords":"","body":"Note Redemption\nLiquidity Notes come with a fixed maturity date, which means the downside protection they offer is not perpetual but ends at a specified date and time. This fixed term allows the downside protection and other features of each Liquidity Note to conclude as scheduled.\nHaving a fixed maturity enables cryptocurrency projects to tailor each Liquidity Note according to their specific needs and the prevailing market conditions. By adjusting the maturity date, projects can align the Liquidity Notes with strategic timelines, market events, or liquidity requirements, providing flexibility in how they manage risk and incentivize participation.\nRedemption Mechanism\nWhen a Liquidity Note reaches its maturity date, holders have two options:\n1. Redemption\nOn the specified maturity date, holders can redeem their Liquidity Notes based on the Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP) of the underlying asset over the 72 hours directly prior to the maturity date/time. Using a 72-hour VWAP helps prevent price manipulation that could influence the redemption price at a specific moment.\nUpon redemption, holders receive the underlying Liquidity Provider (LP) collateral associated with their Liquidity Notes. They can then choose to:\n\nRetain the LP Position: Continue holding the LP tokens if they wish to remain invested in the liquidity pool.\nWithdraw Underlying Assets: Redeem the LP tokens for the constituent cryptocurrencies, effectively exiting the liquidity position.\n\n2. Rollover Extension\nThe cryptocurrency project may offer a rollover option to Liquidity Note holders. In this scenario, the project presents a new Liquidity Note with a new maturity date and potentially revised features, such as adjusted levels of downside protection, upside potential, and yield distribution.\nHolder's Decision:\n\nAccepting the Rollover: If the holder accepts the rollover extension, their existing Liquidity Note is replaced with the new one, which includes the updated terms and extended maturity date.\nDeclining the Rollover: If the holder does not accept the new terms, they can redeem their Liquidity Note as per the default redemption mechanics outlined above.\n\n"},"whitepapers-research.html":{"url":"whitepapers-research.html","title":"Whitepapers/Research","keywords":"","body":"Whitepapers/Research\n"},"glossary.html":{"url":"glossary.html","title":"Glossary","keywords":"","body":"Glossary\n"},"integrate-with-exchequer/integrate-with-exchequer.html":{"url":"integrate-with-exchequer/integrate-with-exchequer.html","title":"Integrate with Exchequer","keywords":"","body":"Integrate with Exchequer\n"},"apis/exchequer-subgraph.html":{"url":"apis/exchequer-subgraph.html","title":"Exchequer Subgraph","keywords":"","body":"Exchequer Subgraph\n"}}}
