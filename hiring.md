# Hiring

Need to hire people who can work async, i.e. very independent, but can also plan ahead and batch questions asking. Lots of people who are productive in synchronous culture cannot be productive in async culture.

Hiring people who are super good at written communication, especially documentation.

Hire senior people, junior people don't work, since senior people require less waiting to ask for answers;

need to hire people who can look at a ticket and complete that ticket without any synchronous communication.

Excellent written english, including maintaining comms over DMs

Self motivated people, that can function without external reinforcement.
