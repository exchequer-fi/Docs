# Collateral Dex

The **Collateral DEX** (Decentralized Exchange) refers to the Automated Market Maker (AMM) platform where the Liquidity Provider (LP) collateral underlying a Liquidity Note is **deposited**. This LP collateral is essential as it underwrites the Liquidity Note, providing the basis for its features such as yield generation, downside protection, and potential upside.

**Supported AMMs**

Currently, the following AMMs are supported for LP collateral:

* **Uniswap V2**
* **Uniswap V3**
* **Uniswap V4**

## **Future Support**

The project aims to support all major AMMs to offer flexibility and access to a wider range of liquidity pools. By expanding support to additional AMMs, users will have the option to choose platforms that best align with their investment strategies and preferences.



## Considerations for Choosing the Collateral DEX

Selecting the appropriate **Collateral Decentralized Exchange (DEX)** is a pivotal decision when configuring a Liquidity Note. The Collateral DEX is the Automated Market Maker (AMM) platform where the Liquidity Provider (LP) collateral backing a Liquidity Note is **deposited**. The choice of Collateral DEX directly impacts the liquidity, stability, and overall performance of the Liquidity Note.

#### Key Considerations

1. **Security and Reliability**
   * **Assessment**: Evaluate the security track record and reliability of the DEX.
   * **Impact**:
     * **Secure DEXs**: Reduce the risk of hacks, exploits, and smart contract vulnerabilities, safeguarding the LP collateral.
     * **Less Secure DEXs**: Pose higher risks of asset loss and undermine investor confidence.
   * **Example**:
     * **Secure DEX**: Uniswap has a strong security reputation with multiple audits and a large user base.
     * **Less Secure DEX**: Newer DEXs without extensive security audits may be riskier choices.
2. **Regulatory Compliance and Transparency**
   * **Assessment**: Ensure that the DEX complies with relevant regulations and offers transparency in its operations.
   * **Impact**:
     * **Compliant DEXs**: Reduce legal risks and enhance trust among investors.
     * **Non-Compliant DEXs**: Expose the project to regulatory scrutiny and potential legal challenges.
   * **Example**:
     * **Compliant DEX**: Uniswap operates in a decentralized manner with clear governance structures, aligning with many regulatory frameworks.
     * **Non-Compliant DEX**: DEXs operating in jurisdictions with unclear regulations may pose legal risks.
3. **User Base and Market Adoption**
   * **Assessment**: Consider the size and activity level of the DEX’s user base.
   * **Impact**:
     * **Large User Base**: Ensures continuous liquidity and active trading, benefiting the Liquidity Note’s performance.
     * **Small User Base**: Limits liquidity and trading opportunities, potentially reducing the Liquidity Note’s attractiveness.
   * **Example**:
     * **Popular DEX**: Uniswap has millions of users and high trading volumes, ensuring ample liquidity.
     * **Niche DEX**: Specialized or less-known DEXs may have limited user engagement and lower liquidity.
4. **Decentralization and Governance**
   * **Assessment**: Evaluate the level of decentralization and the governance mechanisms of the DEX.
   * **Impact**:
     * **Highly Decentralized DEXs**: Offer greater security and resistance to censorship, aligning with the decentralized ethos of DeFi.
     * **Centralized or Semi-Decentralized DEXs**: May introduce governance risks and centralized points of failure.
   * **Example**:
     * **Decentralized DEX**: Uniswap operates through smart contracts without a central authority, ensuring decentralized governance.
     * **Semi-Decentralized DEX**: Some DEXs may have governance tokens but still rely on a central team for key decisions.
