# Welcome to Exchequer

## What is Exchequer?

Exchequer lets crypto projects issue **Protected Growth Tokens (PGTs)** — a new type of token that gives holders downside protection and upside exposure over a fixed term. Think of it as a way to say to your community: *"Buy our token, and even if the price drops, you're protected up to a floor we set."*

Projects use PGTs to run repeatable acquisition campaigns that attract new holders, reward patient believers, and build deep on-chain liquidity — without emissions, token loans, or CEX market-maker retainers.

## The Problem PGTs Solve

Every token project faces the same set of problems after launch:

**New users won't buy your token** because they're afraid of the downside. They've seen too many tokens drop 50–80% and never recover. No amount of narrative changes the risk calculus for cautious allocators.

**Existing holders churn** the moment attention fades. Without a credible reason to stay, mercenary holders sell into any liquidity event.

**Liquidity is expensive and fragile.** CEX market makers charge retainers and token loans. DEX liquidity from emissions attracts farmers who dump the moment yields compress. Neither builds lasting depth.

PGTs solve all three by letting projects subsidize the downside risk directly, on their own terms, using their own treasury tokens as collateral.

## How It Works (Plain English)

Here's the core idea in four steps:

**Step 1 — The project sets the terms.**
You choose: how much downside protection (up to 75%), how long the term lasts (e.g., 6 or 12 months), and what type of upside (linear or jackpot-style).

**Step 2 — Users deposit tokens. The project matches with its own tokens.**
When users buy PGTs, they deposit a designated token (e.g., ETH or a stablecoin — chosen by the project). The project contributes its own tokens from treasury — specifically, **2x the user's deposit value in tokens**. Half goes into a liquidity pool (which funds the downside protection). The other half is set aside as a reserve to pay upside if the token goes up.

**Step 3 — The liquidity pool earns yield for the full term.**
The combined LP position earns trading fees on-chain for the entire duration. The project benefits from deep, stable DEX liquidity as a direct consequence.

**Step 4 — At maturity, everyone settles.**
If the token price dropped: users are protected up to the floor. They get back their principal in LP tokens.
If the token price went up: users get their upside from the reserve. The project gets back its LP position plus yield earned.

That's it. No emissions. No ongoing costs. No counterparty risk — everything is on-chain and auditable.

## A Concrete Example

Say you're a project with a $1.00 token and you want to raise $1M in on-chain liquidity through a 12-month PGT campaign with 50% downside protection.

| | Amount |
|---|---|
| **Users deposit** | $500,000 (in the designated deposit token) |
| **Project contributes** | 1,000,000 tokens (worth $1,000,000) |
| **LP position created** | $1,000,000 (500K deposit tokens + 500K project tokens) |
| **Upside reserve** | 500,000 tokens held separately |
| **Assumed LP yield** | 15% APR |
| **Term** | 12 months |

**What users get:** A PGT token that protects them against up to a 50% price drop. If the token goes to $0.50, they still get their $500K principal back in LP tokens. If the token goes up, they participate in the upside from the reserve.

**What the project gets:** $1,000,000 in locked, deep on-chain DEX liquidity for 12 months. Plus the LP yield (~$150,000 at 15% APR). At maturity, the project redeems its LP position (after user payouts) plus any unused reserve tokens.

**What it costs the project:** 1,000,000 tokens locked for 12 months. If the token price stays flat or goes up, the project gets most of its tokens back plus yield. If the token drops significantly, the project's tokens absorb the loss (that's the protection working as designed).

## Two Product Types

Exchequer offers two variants of Protected Growth Tokens. Both provide downside protection — they differ in how upside is delivered.

### PGT (Protected Growth Token)
**Floor + linear upside.** If the token goes up, you participate proportionally — like holding spot, but with a safety net underneath. Best for conviction holders and larger allocators who want a clean, simple payoff.

### Power PGT (Power Protected Growth Token)
**Floor + jackpot-style upside.** If the token goes up, the gains are pooled and distributed through a prize drawing — with a top tier paying up to 10,000× the base prize. Everyone still gets the protection floor. Best for community campaigns, smaller tickets, and attention-driven acquisition where gamified upside converts new users.

## Why Projects Choose Exchequer

**Budgetable cost, not open-ended emissions.** You commit a fixed number of tokens for a fixed term. You know exactly what you're putting in.

**Liquidity as a designed consequence.** Every PGT campaign creates deep, on-chain DEX liquidity that compounds over repeated issuances.

**Repeatable campaigns.** Run seasonal PGT programs — quarterly, around roadmap milestones, or during market dips when fear is highest and protection is most compelling.

**Fully on-chain and trustless.** No counterparties, no token loans, no CEX dependencies. Smart contracts are persistent and non-upgradeable. All collateral is auditable.

**Two modes for different goals.** Use PGT for clean institutional-grade exposure, Power PGT for viral community campaigns. Alternate based on market conditions.
