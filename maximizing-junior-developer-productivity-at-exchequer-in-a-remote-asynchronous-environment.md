# Maximizing Junior Developer Productivity at Exchequer in a Remote Asynchronous Environment



At Exchequer, we understand that junior developers face unique challenges when adapting to our remote, asynchronous (async) work environment. To help them succeed and grow, we’ve developed specific processes and strategies tailored to address these challenges, ensuring that our junior developers can become productive and confident members of our team. This article outlines the common issues junior developers might encounter at Exchequer and how we work together to overcome them using our communication tools: Slack, GitBook, and ClickUp.

### 1. Providing Immediate Guidance <a href="#qr37ikxp6nuq" id="qr37ikxp6nuq"></a>

#### Challenge: <a href="#injqhq9culsc" id="injqhq9culsc"></a>

Junior developers often need real-time feedback and guidance to avoid getting stuck or heading down the wrong path. In an async environment like ours, delays in receiving feedback can hinder their progress and lead to frustration.

\- Comprehensive Documentation in GitBook: We maintain detailed documentation in GitBook, covering our processes, coding standards, and best practices. Junior developers are encouraged to use this resource as their first point of reference, which reduces their need for real-time guidance.

\- Onboarding Buddy System: At Exchequer, every junior developer is paired with a more experienced team member who serves as their mentor. This mentor provides guidance primarily through async communication in Slack and ClickUp, with scheduled check-ins to discuss progress and address any challenges.

\- Clear Task Breakdown in ClickUp: Tasks assigned to junior developers are broken down into smaller, manageable parts in ClickUp. This approach ensures that they have a clear understanding of what is expected and minimizes the chances of them getting stuck.

### 2. Ensuring Timely Feedback <a href="#stih0rftc7c9" id="stih0rftc7c9"></a>

#### Challenge: <a href="#m8ot53c67aep" id="m8ot53c67aep"></a>

Frequent feedback is essential for the growth of junior developers. However, the asynchronous nature of our communication can sometimes delay the feedback they need to learn and improve.

#### Our Process at Exchequer: <a href="#id-8nrlvse51w5y" id="id-8nrlvse51w5y"></a>

\- Regular Code Reviews in ClickUp: We have a structured code review process in ClickUp, ensuring that all code submissions receive timely and constructive feedback. Reviewers are encouraged to provide detailed comments to help junior developers understand and learn from their mistakes.

\- Encouraging Self-Review: Junior developers are encouraged to review their own code before submitting it for review. This self-review process helps them catch common errors and develop critical thinking skills, which are essential in an async environment.

\- Scheduled Sync Sessions: While most of our communication is async, we schedule occasional synchronous sessions via Slack calls or video conferencing specifically for providing feedback and addressing any immediate concerns that junior developers might have.

### 3. Building Context and Understanding <a href="#j1yhfzb1jkq" id="j1yhfzb1jkq"></a>

#### Challenge: <a href="#ky1gxqsup6kb" id="ky1gxqsup6kb"></a>

Understanding the broader context of their work can be difficult for junior developers in a remote environment, where they might miss out on spontaneous discussions and informal learning opportunities.

#### Our Process at Exchequer: <a href="#caivgpn9w1u1" id="caivgpn9w1u1"></a>

\- Thorough Onboarding in GitBook: We provide a comprehensive onboarding program documented in GitBook. This includes an overview of the project, team roles, and how each junior developer’s work contributes to our larger company goals. This helps them build context from the start.

\- Async Knowledge Sharing in GitBook: We maintain a robust knowledge base in GitBook, which includes FAQs, troubleshooting guides, and detailed explanations of complex topics. Junior developers are encouraged to consult this resource to build their understanding.

\- Encouraging Questions in Slack: At Exchequer, we foster a culture where asking questions is highly encouraged. Junior developers are welcome to post their questions in dedicated Slack channels, where they can expect to receive thoughtful responses within a reasonable timeframe.

### 4. Combating Isolation and Fostering Peer Interaction <a href="#x9j38e3w7dlx" id="x9j38e3w7dlx"></a>

#### Challenge: <a href="#e5y73da5v7rk" id="e5y73da5v7rk"></a>

The isolation that can come with remote work may make junior developers feel disconnected from the team, missing out on the informal interactions that occur naturally in an office setting.

#### Our Process at Exchequer: <a href="#s6ug21rl5ae9" id="s6ug21rl5ae9"></a>

\- Virtual Pair Programming: We regularly organize virtual pair programming sessions through Slack, where junior developers can collaborate directly with more experienced team members. This interaction not only aids their learning but also helps them feel more connected to the team.

\- Social Channels and Virtual Events on Slack: We have dedicated Slack channels for non-work-related topics and organize virtual social events to help team members bond. These initiatives are key to ensuring that junior developers feel integrated into the team culture.

\- Regular Team Updates in ClickUp: We conduct regular async team updates or stand-ups in ClickUp, where everyone shares their current work. This helps junior developers stay informed and feel part of the broader team activities.

### 5. Managing Autonomy <a href="#iancjxm2u6hy" id="iancjxm2u6hy"></a>

#### Challenge: <a href="#mktc1238vgpo" id="mktc1238vgpo"></a>

The high level of autonomy in an async environment can be overwhelming for junior developers, who may not yet be accustomed to managing their time and tasks independently.

#### Our Process at Exchequer: <a href="#nwx0q01qp922" id="nwx0q01qp922"></a>

\- Structured Workflows in ClickUp: Junior developers are provided with clear and structured workflows in ClickUp, including defined deadlines and priorities. This structure helps them manage their time effectively and ensures they stay on track.

\- Goal Setting and Tracking: We set clear, achievable goals for junior developers, broken down into smaller milestones. These goals are tracked in ClickUp, helping them visualize their progress and stay motivated.

\- Regular Check-Ins via Slack: We schedule regular check-ins with junior developers via Slack to discuss their progress, challenges, and any additional support they might need. These check-ins ensure they don’t feel overwhelmed and have a clear path forward.

By following these processes, we at Exchequer ensure that our junior developers receive the guidance, feedback, and support they need to thrive in our remote async environment. These strategies are designed to help them grow into productive and confident members of our team, contributing effectively to our collective success.

### Challenges: <a href="#id-4uz2ldacrqvx" id="id-4uz2ldacrqvx"></a>

1. People get blocked, requiring to know when they get unblocked, i.e., teamwork, so teamwork doesn't work as well in async culture.
2. Lots of requests for information, which leads to constant disruptions
3. To avoid bottlenecking, documentation has to be super up-to-date and low context; this requires people to spend MORE time documenting something BEFORE they do it. This becomes the key to making async work so that people can refer to documentation.
4. Projects move slower than synchronous culture, and each individual should be working on multiple streams of work to avoid roadblocks.

### Advantages; <a href="#u72yqmeqrkbt" id="u72yqmeqrkbt"></a>

1. Focus time, no disruptions for engineers
2. Assess to global talent pool - work with the most talented people across countries and time zones.

### Team Structure <a href="#ip1d9u7oua6r" id="ip1d9u7oua6r"></a>

1. Managers and business people are mostly interrupt driven, so they have to work in a synchronous way. Devs/engineers are deep work driven, so they work better async. If business people and Managers need to interact with devs, it's a clash of styles.
2. For development, need to be able to write tickets that a developer can read the entire ticket and get full context on how to implement without having to have a meeting about it.
3. Each person needs multiple parallel work streams so they are not blocked.
4. Work needs to be designed so teamwork is minimised, as back and forths are extremely inefficient in remote async.

### Management; <a href="#rl67s462k6ag" id="rl67s462k6ag"></a>

1. Judge devs by Pull requests, velocity of them
2. Quality of PRs
3. mandatory code reviews, test and deployment automation

### Culture; <a href="#nuelxhk37wgk" id="nuelxhk37wgk"></a>

1. Documentation culture, code - documentation like it's an open source project, i.e. new dev has to be able to read the[ read.me](http://read.me/) and understand how to update.
2. NOn-dev documentation. SSOT(single source of truth), wiki, Org Chart, HR, onboarding, system architecture, mission, vision, etc...
3. Document before doing something, this forces approval of the plan/strategy, etc...and then revise the documentation after implementation.
4. Enforce a single comms medium, that all use cases are covered, detail how and what use cases the channel should be used.
5. All meetings are scheduled in advance with agendas and documentation, recorded and made available for people to async view them if necessary.
